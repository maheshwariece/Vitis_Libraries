1.0
----

Vitis HPC Libraray 1.0 release introduces HLS primitives, prebuild kernles and software APIs for HPC applications on FPGAs. These applications are: 

* 2D Acoustic RTM (Reverse Time Migration) FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) algorithm

* MLP (Mult-Layer Perceptron) components: activation functions and fully connected network kernels 

2.0
----

Vitis HPC Libraray 2.0 release introduces HLS primitives, prebuild kernles and software APIs for HPC applications on FPGAs. These applications are: 

* 2D Acoustic RTM (Reverse Time Migration) FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) algorithm, including forward kernel and backward kernel

* 3D Acoustic RTM (Reverse Time Migration) FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) algorithm, including forward kernel

* MLP (Mult-Layer Perceptron) components: activation functions and fully connected network kernels 

* PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient) Solvers for both dense matrix and sparse matrix
